# 🚀 Job Search Tool

The **Job Search Tool** is an **AI-powered application** that helps job seekers by automatically fetching job openings from multiple portals (e.g., LinkedIn, Naukri). Just type in your desired **keywords** (like *“Java Developer”* or *“Data Scientist”*) and get a consolidated list of jobs with **direct application links** — all in one place.
